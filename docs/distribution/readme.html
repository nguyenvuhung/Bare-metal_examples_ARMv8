        <a name="Purpose%20and%20Scope"></a><h2>Purpose and Scope</h2>
        <div class="para">This document describes the "DS-5 Linux Example Distribution" package that can be downloaded from the Downloads page of <a href="http://ds.arm.com" title="External link"><i>ARM Development Studio 5 (DS-5) Web Site</i></a>, its use within DS-5, and its operation on the VE-Cortex-A9x1 FVP model and VE-Cortex-A9x4 FVP model supplied with DS-5.  It can be imported into Eclipse in the same way as the other examples, or it can be unzipped alongside the other examples.</div>

        <ul>
            <li><div class="para">Boot Linux on the VE-Cortex-A9x1 FVP model and VE-Cortex-A9x4 FVP model supplied with DS-5, using the pre-built Linux images</div></li>

        <div class="para">This project is not required to run the Linux application examples, because those projects include pre-built images. It <span class="bold">is</span> required if you wish to rebuild the Linux application examples.</div>

        <h3>Hardware and software requirements</h3>
        <div class="para">No special hardware is required to run the example ARM Linux distribution. All required software is included in DS-5 except for the distribution itself.</div>
        <div class="para">If you wish to rebuild components of this distribution then you will need access to a Linux host machine. Attempting to perform these tasks on a Windows host is neither recommended nor supported. You may need root privileges on the host system for some operations involved in rebuilding the target filesystem.</div>

        <h3>Terminology</h3>
        <div class="para">This document discusses 'host' and 'target' systems. The 'host' system is the Linux or Windows desktop computer that you use for most of your work. The 'target' system is some ARM-based hardware (or model of such hardware) on which the example ARM Linux distribution is running.</div>

        <div class="para">The VE-Cortex-A9x1 FVP model is a model of the Versatile Express platform with a single Cortex-A9 Core Tile.  The VE-Cortex-A9x4 FVP model is a model of the Versatile Express platform with a quadcore Cortex-A9 Core Tile.  More details about these models can be found in <a href="http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.dui0837-/index.html"><i>Fixed Virtual Platforms FVP Reference Guide</i></a>. The supplied distribution may be used with these models for both application debug and kernel debug.</div>

        <div class="para">The usual way to run the distribution is via the DS-5 Debugger. This assumes that you have a target application to debug. If you want to run the distribution via the command line, or if you want to run the distribution for some purpose other than debugging an application, then see the instructions in <a href="./readme.html#cli_run"><i>Running the Distribution From the Command Line</i></a>.</div>

        <a name="Interacting%20with%20the%20Linux%20System"></a><h2>Interacting with the Linux System</h2>
        <h3>Mouse, Keyboard, Display</h3>
        <div class="para">The model boots into a GNOME Mobile desktop, which can be interacted with by selecting the model's display window and then using the mouse or typing as normal.</div>
        <div class="note"><div class="para">
<div class="bold">Note</div>
<div>The host mouse pointer may not align with the target mouse pointer. In this event, you can hide the host mouse pointer by pressing the key combination indicated in top right-hand corner of the model's display window. Pressing this key combination again will redisplay the host mouse pointer.</div>
</div></div>

        <h3>Remote System Explorer</h3>
        <div class="para">The Remote System Explorer plug-ins are integrated into the DS-5 Eclipse IDE. This can be used to log on to target systems and to transfer files between host and target systems. Alternatively, you can use the methods referred to below.</div>

        <h3>Logging on to the Target Linux System</h3>
        <div class="para">The distribution will either run a shell on the boot console, or permit login on the boot console. You should be able to access this shell via serial port. Login as <span class="emphasis"><span class="bold">root</span></span> with no password.</div>
        <div class="para">The distribution also runs an ssh server, which can be connected to as with any ssh session. The ssh server accepts passwordless root logins, for example,</div>
        <pre class="code">ssh root@192.168.0.2</pre>
        <div class="para">where <span class="arg">192.168.0.2</span> is the IP address of the target Linux system.</div>
        <div class="para">Be aware that the ssh server included in the distribution does not support tunnelling of X-sessions.</div>

        <h3>Transferring Files Between Host and Target</h3>
        <div class="para">scp can be used to transfer files. For example, to transfer the file <span class="arg">foo</span> from the current directory on the host to <span class="arg">/root</span> on the target system, type:</div>
        <pre class="code">scp foo root@192.168.0.2:</pre>

        <h3>Shutting Down the Target Linux System</h3>
        <div class="para">Before rebooting or powering down the system you should run the command <span class="arg">halt</span> and wait until the system displays the message <span class="arg">System halted</span>.  Powering down without halting risks filesystem corruption.</div>

        <a name="Using%20the%20Example%20Distribution%20to%20work%20with%20your%20own%20Application"></a><h2>Using the Example Distribution to work with your own Application</h2>
        <div class="para">The example distribution can be used to work with your own applications. However any dependencies of your application must be available on the target system. Provided that you have your own copies of these dependencies you can copy them onto the target system. It is most likely that you will need to do this with shared libraries, and this should work so long as your libraries are EABI-compliant and compatible with the kernel and low-level system libraries (e.g. libc) in the target distribution.</div>
        <div class="para">It is recommended that you do not attempt to install your own libraries in system areas such as <span class="arg">/lib</span> or <span class="arg">/usr/lib</span>, as this changes the base configuration of the operating system. It is strongly recommended that you do not replace any of the example distribution's libraries with your own versions as this is quite likely to break the example distribution. Instead, you should copy such libraries to a directory on the example distribution and then set the <span class="arg">LD_LIBRARY_PATH</span> environment variable to search this directory for shared library dependencies. For example:</div>
        <pre class="code">(On host) scp -r <span class="repl">&lt;your root filesystem&gt;</span> root@<span class="repl">&lt;target's IP address&gt;</span>:/root/myrootfs</pre>
        <pre class="code">(On target) export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/root/myrootfs</pre>
        <pre class="code">(On target) gdbserver :5000 /root/myrootfs/<span class="repl">&lt;my application&gt;</span></pre>
        <div class="para">When building your own applications to run on the example distribution you must use the ARM Linux Distribution Dependencies project and set the compiler option <span class="arg">--sysroot=<span class="repl">&lt;...&gt;</span>/distribution/filesystem/linaro_hf</span> in order to build against the correct headers and libraries. <span class="repl">&lt;...&gt;</span> is the location that the distribution dependencies project has been unzipped to.</div>
        <div class="para">The ARM Linux Distribution Dependencies project is not included with the other Linux examples, but is provided in the "DS-5 Linux Example Distribution" package that can be downloaded from the Downloads page of <a href="http://ds.arm.com" title="External link"><i>ARM Development Studio 5 (DS-5) Web Site</i></a>.  It can be imported into Eclipse in the same way as the other examples, or it can be unzipped alongside the other examples.</div>
