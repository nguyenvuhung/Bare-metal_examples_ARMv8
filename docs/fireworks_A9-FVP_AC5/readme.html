        <div class="para">This example demonstrates the support for building and debugging ARMv7 SMP bare-metal applications with ARM Compiler 5 and DS-5 Debugger.
        Fireworks is a simple bare-metal example written in C and assembler that produces a graphical simulated fireworks display and flying aeroplane banner on the screen.</div>
        <div class="para">For the single core model, the core moves the fireworks and the banner. For the multi-core model, core 0 moves the fireworks and core 1 moves the banner (cores 2 and 3 just sleep).</div>
        <div class="para">This bare-metal example is specifically targeted at VE-Cortex-A9x1 FVP model or VE-Cortex-A9x4 FVP model, complete with vector table, reset handler,
        interrupt handler, cache and MMU config, NEON support, interrupt controller (GIC) and timer initialization, LCD screen driver, retargeted printf() output to a UART, etc.</div>

        <div class="para">This example is intended to be built with ARM Compiler 5. If you wish to modify and rebuild the example, you must use ARM Compiler 5 to rebuild it.</div>
        <div class="para">The executable builds with a base address 0x80000000, and is intended for running on VE-Cortex-A9x1 FVP model or VE-Cortex-A9x4 FVP model.  The executable determines automatically whether it is running on a single core or multi-core model.</div>
        <div class="para">A pre-built executable (<span class="arg">fireworks-Cortex-A9xN-FVP.axf</span>) is provided, that can run on either the single-core or multi-core model.</div>
        <div class="para">This example does not depend on any semihosting support being provided by DS-5 Debugger.</div>
        <div class="para">Ready-made launch configurations <span class="arg">fireworks_AC5-Cortex-A9x1-FVP.launch</span>  and <span class="arg">fireworks_AC5-Cortex-A9x4-FVP.launch</span> are provided.</div>
        <div class="para">For a good debug view, the compiler's optimization level is set to -O1 in the <span class="arg">makefile</span>.
         You can change this to raise the optimization level to -O2 or -O3 for higher performance code generation, but at the cost of a worse debug view.</div>

<pre class="code">  Reset Vector
       |
  Reset_Handler()
       |
       ----------------------
       |                    |
  primaryCPUInit()   secondaryCPUsInit()
       |                    |
    __main()            holding_pen
       |                    :
     main()                 :
       |                    :
   SendSGI()                |
       |                    |
       ----- main_app() -----

  fireworks(cpu0)     fireworks(cpu1)
       |                    |
  moveSpark()          moveBanner()
</pre>
        <div class="para">The first stage of boot is the reset handler, which is common to all CPUs.  In this stage the stack pointers, MMU, page tables and caches are initialized.</div>
        <div class="para">For the second stage of boot CPU0 is treated as the primary CPU, and CPU1 is treated as secondary CPU.</div>
        <div class="para">The secondary CPU (CPU1) branches to <span class="arg">secondaryCPUsInit()</span>.  This function carries out only CPU specific (local) initialization.
        For the example this involves enabling the Processor Interface of the Interrupt Controller, and enabling the receipt of Software Generated Interrupts (SGIs).
        Once the initialization is complete the secondary CPU enters a holding pen.  It is released from the holding pen by a SGI from the primary CPU.</div>
        <div class="para">CPU0 is the primary CPU and branches to <span class="arg">primaryCPUInit()</span>.  This function performs some local initialization, but also the cluster wide (global) configuration.
        This includes configuring the SCU, and the global enable for the Interrupt Controller.  On reaching main() the primary CPU also initializes the global data used by the application.
        Once this is done it releases the secondary CPUs from the holding pen by sending a SGI.</div>

        <h3>Description of the Code Execution</h3>
        <div class="para">The main fireworks application is launched from <span class="arg">main()</span>.  <span class="arg">main()</span> is only executed by CPU0.
        <span class="arg">main()</span> performs global system operations that must be done just once.
        For example, it clears the screen, initializes the timer, wakes-up the secondary CPU, and enables the IRQ input to CPU0.
        Finally, <span class="arg">main()</span> starts an application thread <span class="arg">main_app()</span>.</div>
        <div class="para">When CPU1 wakes-up, it also calls <span class="arg">main_app()</span>, so the <span class="arg">main_app()</span> gets executed by both CPU0 and CPU1.
        <span class="arg">main_app()</span> performs per-core operations such as enabling caches and branch prediction, then calls <span class="arg">fireworks()</span>.</div>
        <div class="para">CPU0 runs the main fireworks application that fires "sparks" as fast as it can.  CPU1 displays and scrolls the banner.
        During the fireworks display, CPU0's private timer is also ticking, generating interrupts.  On each interrupt, the LEDs are advanced one position.</div>
