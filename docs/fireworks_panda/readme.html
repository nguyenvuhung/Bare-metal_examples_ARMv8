        <div class="para">This example is intended to illustrate the symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) features of the DS-5 Debugger.
        Fireworks is a simple bare-metal example written in C and assembler that uses PandaBoard SMP to produce a graphical simulated fireworks display and flying banner on the screen
        using shared memory to arrange co-operation between the cores. </div>               
        <div class="para">To show the co-operation of both cores, Cortex-A9_0 core displays the fireworks and Cortex-A9_1 displays the flying logo.</div>
        <div class="para">This bare-metal fireworks example is specifically targeted at PandaBoard, complete with vector table, reset handler,
        interrupt handler, cache and MMU config, NEON support, interrupt controller and timer initialization, LCD screen driver, retargeted printf() output to a UART, etc.</div>

        <h3>Hardware and software requirements</h3>

        <li><div class="para">DSTREAM debug hardware and a suitable power supply for it, and a JTAG cable to connect it to PandaBoard</div></li>
        <li><div class="para">Optionally, a standard computer LCD screen, connected via a DVI-D cable to PandaBoard DVI-D connector.
        The fireworks display can alternatively be viewed in the DS-5 Debugger Screen view.</div></li>
        <li><div class="para">A serial terminal emulator such as the Terminal view in DS-5, TeraTerm for Windows (<a href="http://hp.vector.co.jp/authors/VA002416/teraterm.html" title="External link"><i>TeraTerm Website</i></a>) or minicom for Linux, connected via a serial cable to your platform.  This may be needed when running the example on real target hardware, to monitor the Boot Loader and provide a serial terminal interface.  This is not needed if using a software model as that provides its own terminal.  To open the Terminal view in DS-5, select <span class="menu">Window<span class="para"> → </span>Show View<span class="para"> → </span>Other...</span> to open the Show View dialog box, then expand the <span class="interface">Terminal</span> group and select <span class="interface">Terminal</span>, and click OK.  To configure the terminal settings, click on <span class="interface">Settings</span> in the <span class="interface">Terminal</span> view, then select the required connection type (for example, Serial), then enter the required settings (for example, 38400 baud, 8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit) and click OK.

        Furthermore, any use of the printf() function in the application is output via the UART on the same serial connection.</div></li>

</pre>
        <div class="para">The first stage of boot is the reset handler, which is common to all CPUs.  In this stage the stack pointers, MMU, page tables and caches are initialized.</div>
        <div class="para">For the second stage of boot CPU0 is treated as the primary CPU, and CPU1 is treated as secondary CPU.</div>
        <div class="para">The secondary CPU (CPU1) branches to <span class="arg">secondaryCPUsInit()</span>.  This function carries out only CPU specific (local) initialization.
        For the example this involves enabling the Processor Interface of the Interrupt Controller, and enabling the receipt of Software Generated Interrupts (SGIs).
        Once the initialization is complete the secondary CPU enters a holding pen.  It is released from the holding pen by a SGI from the primary CPU.</div>
        <div class="para">CPU0 is the primary CPU and branches to <span class="arg">primaryCPUInit()</span>.  This function performs some local initialization, but also the cluster wide (global) configuration.
        This includes configuring the SCU, and the global enable for the Interrupt Controller.  On reaching main() the primary CPU also initializes the global data used by the application.
        Once this is done it releases the secondary CPUs from the holding pen by sending a SGI.</div>
        
        <h3>Description of the Code Execution</h3>
        <div class="para">The main fireworks application is launched from <span class="arg">main()</span>.  <span class="arg">main()</span> is only executed by CPU0.
        <span class="arg">main()</span> performs global system operations that must be done just once.
        For example, it clears the screen, initializes the timer, wakes-up the secondary CPU, and enables the IRQ input to CPU0.
        Finally, <span class="arg">main()</span> starts an application thread <span class="arg">main_app()</span>.</div>
        <div class="para">When CPU1 wakes-up, it also calls <span class="arg">main_app()</span>, so the <span class="arg">main_app()</span> gets executed by both CPU0 and CPU1.
        <span class="arg">main_app()</span> performs per-core operations such as enabling caches and branch prediction, then calls <span class="arg">fireworks()</span>.</div>
        <div class="para">CPU0 runs the main fireworks application that fires "sparks" as fast as it can.  CPU1 displays and scrolls the banner.
        During the fireworks display, CPU0's private timer is also ticking, generating interrupts.  On each interrupt, the LEDs are advanced one position.</div>
