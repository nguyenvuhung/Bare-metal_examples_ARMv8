This may be needed when running the example on real target hardware, to monitor the Boot Loader and provide a serial terminal interface.

        <div class="para">The <span class="arg">moveSpark()</span> function is a critical loop within the fireworks program.  It is used to calculate the next position of every spark.  As there can be several thousand sparks alive at any moment, it is important that this calculation loop is performed efficiently.  Add the following code to the start of <span class="arg">moveSpark()</span>:</div>
<pre class="code">
   	if (loopCount &gt;= 0x1000)
   	{

        <div class="para">This code uses the performance monitors to measure the number of Instructions Executed and Cycle Count (CCNT) taken to calculate the next positions of a fairly large (&gt;= 0x1000) number of sparks.  When compiling with NEON auto-vectorization, ARM Compiler 5 can compile the <span class="arg">moveSpark()</span> function to take advantage of NEON, so that calculations can be performed on 4 sparks in parallel at a time.  For example, for 0x1100 sparks, only 0x440 iterations of the loop are required.  You can use the Registers view to watch the loop counter in a register counting down from 0x440 to zero.</div>

        <div class="para">The calculations needed to create and move the Shells and Sparks in this example can be performed very quickly - most of the time to execute fireworks is taken by writing pixels to the display buffer in the <span class="arg">plot()</span> function.  To measure by how much the display is the performance bottleneck, try timing 10000 <span class="arg">drawSparks()</span> loops using the millisecond timer, using this code in the <span class="arg">fireworks()</span> function:</div>

    <div class="para">Recompile, and run the code.  After some time, you will see on the serial terminal timings like:</div>

Time (millisecs) = 14029
Time (millisecs) = 13982
Time (millisecs) = 13690

<div class="para">This shows 10000 <span class="arg">drawSparks()</span> loops takes about 14 seconds on average.  These timings were for a BeagleBoard.  BeagleBoard-xM timings might be better.  If you do not have a serial terminal connected, set a breakpoint outside the <span class="arg">for()</span> loop, and view the global variable <span class="arg">tick_count</span>.</div>
    <div class="para">Now replace the content of the <span class="arg">plot()</span> function with a <span class="arg">__nop()</span>:</div>
<pre class="code">
static void plot(int x, int y, int color)
{
	__nop();
//	((volatile unsigned short *)FRAME_BUFFER)[y * LCD_WIDTH + x] = color;
}
</pre>
    <div class="para">
<span class="arg">__nop()</span> is an ARM Compiler intrinsic that compiles to a NOP instruction.  The compiler does not optimize away the NOP instructions (except for normal unreachable code elimination), so this ensures the <span class="arg">plot()</span> function is retained and not optimized away.  The <span class="arg">__nop()</span> intrinsic also acts as an instruction scheduling barrier, that ensures instructions are not moved from one side of the NOP to the other as a result of optimization.</div>
    <div class="para">Recompile, and run the code again.  No fireworks will appear on the display anymore because nothing is being written to it.  The 10000 <span class="arg">drawSparks()</span> loops now take about 3 seconds on average.  This demonstrates that about 20% of the time is being used to perform the calculations, and about 80% to write to the display.  Again, these timings were for a BeagleBoard.  BeagleBoard-xM timings might be better.</div>
