        <a name="Purpose%20and%20scope"></a><h2>Purpose and scope</h2>
        <div class="para">This example is intended to illustrate the symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) features of the DS-5 Debugger.  Primes is a simple bare-metal, semihosted example written in C and assembler that uses up to four cores to find prime numbers, using shared memory and mutexes to arrange co-operation between the cores.  Being semihosted and not relying on any special peripherals, the smp_primes project can be easily ported to other platforms by simply changing the scatter file.  This variant of the primes example is intended to be run on a VE-Cortex-A9x4 FVP model, Versatile Express Cortex-A9x4 or PandaBoard platform.  Ready-made launch configurations <span class="arg">smp_primes_AC5-FVP-A9x4.launch</span>, <span class="arg">smp_primes_AC5-versatile-A9x4.launch</span> and <span class="arg">smp_primes_AC5-panda.launch</span> are provided.</div>

        <h3>Hardware and software requirements</h3>
        <div class="para">To run this example on VE-Cortex-A9x4 FVP model, no extra hardware or software is required (the model is supplied with DS-5)</div>
        <div class="para">To run this example on real target hardware, you will need:</div>
        <ul>
           <li><div class="para">A Versatile Express Cortex-A9x4 or PandaBoard (or other supported ARM target) and a suitable power supply for it</div></li>
           <li><div class="para">DSTREAM debug hardware with its power supply, and JTAG cable to connect to the ARM target</div></li>
        </ul>
        <div class="note"><div class="para">
<div class="bold">Note</div>
<div>This example assumes that you have set up a board for bare-metal debugging. For a PandaBoard you can format and partition an SD card, then copy x-loader (MLO) onto SD boot partition. See the <a href="http://omappedia.org/wiki/Minimal-FS" title="External link"><i>OMAPpedia.org Wiki portal - PandaBoard Minimal-FS</i></a>. Ensure that you use the latest version of x-loader (with debug enabled) from the <a href="http://gitorious.org/x-loader" title="External link"><i>official x-loader GIT</i></a> repository.</div>
</div></div>

        <div class="para"> The source code is intended to be built with ARM Compiler 5 and depends on semihosting support being provided by the debug system. ARM Compiler 5 is provided with DS-5 and the DS-5 Debugger will automatically enable semihosting if the image is built with ARM Compiler 5.</div>
